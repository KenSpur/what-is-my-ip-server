}

resource "azurerm_container_app_environment" "example" {
  name                       = "cae-example"
  location                   = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name        = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}

resource "azurerm_container_app" "example" {
  name                         = "ca-example"
  container_app_environment_id = azurerm_container_app_environment.example.id
  resource_group_name          = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  revision_mode                = "Single"

  template {
    container {
      name   = "what-is-my-ip-server"
      image  = "ghcr.io/kenspur/what-is-my-ip-server:v0.1.2"
      cpu    = 0.25
      memory = "0.5Gi"
    }
